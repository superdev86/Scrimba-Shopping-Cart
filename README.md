# Scrimba-Shopping-Cart
This mobile-friendly web application simulates a shopping cart experience, allowing users to add and remove items from their shopping list. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase, and developed with Vite, this project provides a practical introduction to integrating a database while enhancing my skills in front-end development.

I developed this project as part of a Scrimba course, which served as excellent practice for working with Firebase and improving my understanding of basic CSS and JavaScript concepts.

## Live Demo
You can try the application here: [Shopping Cart Web App](https://scrimba-shopping-cart.vercel.app/)

Note: The database is set to allow public write access, enabling anyone to add and modify items until November 14, 2024.
